## Week 8 Homework

You will be implementing the Stack ADT as an linked liist-based class. The `Stack` abstract class and the `ArrayStack` is already given to you along with the header file for the `LinkedListStack` class, and a skeleton of its implementation file.
Also, there is a factory class `StackFactory` provided that can be used to create a stack. The choice of which type of stack to create is based on if length parameter is passed for the GetStack() method.
You are also in charge of writing your own driver program to test your `LinkedListStack` class. 

Be thorough with your testing by checking all the operations in different scenarios and with various data types. Also, verify both types of stacks behave similaarly.
